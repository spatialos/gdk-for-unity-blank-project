# About

This is a blank project that you can use to as a base for your own game with the [SpatialOS GDK for Unity](https://github.com/spatialos/gdk-for-unity). It has the GDK boilerplate required to start developing games for SpatialOS:

- A Unity project already setup with the [SpatialOS GDK for Unity](https://github.com/spatialos/gdk-for-unity).
- Sample [deployment](https://documentation.improbable.io/gdk-for-unity/docs/gdk-glossary#section-deploying) configurations for local and cloud.
- [Client-worker and server-worker](https://documentation.improbable.io/gdk-for-unity/docs/gdk-glossary#section-worker) JSON [configuration files](https://documentation.improbable.io/spatialos-overview/docs/spl-worker-configuration-file).
- Client-worker and server-worker [connectors](https://documentation.improbable.io/gdk-for-unity/docs/worker-connectors) & worker prefabs.
- A set of Unity Scenes to use in development.
- [Build configuration](https://documentation.improbable.io/gdk-for-unity/docs/your-unity-project-2-build-your-workers) with sensible defaults.
- An empty [snapshot](https://documentation.improbable.io/gdk-for-unity/docs/snapshots) and stub code for generating new snapshots in the Unity Editor.
